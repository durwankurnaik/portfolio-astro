<h2 class="heading-2">Hola Amigo!!!</h2>

Welcome to my _first blog_. I shared my thoughts and experience on how I built this site with Astro. I have already built my portfolio site with Astro (as the meta framework) and SolidJS (for some reactive components) and it was very awesome. Although I had it before which was built using Next.JS but it seems like Next is overkill for an static website like mine which is more of a static content site, so Astro was obvious choice. Also I didn't made any project using Astro so it was good idea to use it in my portfolio site. I had this idea of having a blog of my own but didn't want to use some service like blogspot or medium, it is for NPC's. If you use one, you are a NPC. Having your blog on a site which you made completely, it's just awesome. You have a lot of control over the content and you don't need to go as per the rules of some platform on which you are sharing your thoughts. It's complete bullshit.

<h2 class="heading-2">My weird obsession with blog</h2>

Well, for a developer, they need to showcase their work on the internet and most of them do it by using their dev portfolio. But it is good to extend that by having your own blog in your portfolio site. In your portfolio site, you can add just few things in the projects section because you need to convey most of the important stuff to the viewer and try to get him know the overview and technologies used in the project. This makes it hard to add complete detail about a project that you need to add so that if anyone is interested to read the full details, they can do it by going to your blog post. This gives your thoughts and experiences about that project. How you tackled the issues you faced in the project. This helps the person who is reading to kinda judge the person according to what methodologies they used or what tech stack they are using and how they approached the particular problem. Well it is not always helpful but sometimes it is good to share the nitty-gritty of the project so that if you ever encountered a similar type of error, you may read your blog and it helps you as a documentation rather than going on internet and wandering through hundreds of links.

<h2 class="heading-2">My Experience with Astro</h2>

Well, building this site was not that hard because I just migrated it from Next.JS and before I was using tailwind to style my components so it was mostly just copy-paste. It was piece of cake because Astro has great integration for other frameworks. It took me about 1 day to complete the migration from Next.JS for portfolio and about 1 day to build the blog. I followed along with <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/" target="_blank" class="underline underline-offset-[6px]">this tutorial</a> for building the blog and setting up all the routing and stuff. It was very easy and very straight-forward.

<h2 class="heading-2">What's next?</h2>

I am planning to add tags and filtering according to tags on this blog. But I need to add more blog posts to do it otherwise it won't make any sense to filtering if I have only 1 or 2 blog posts. I planning to share my thoughts on Tech space and be proactive with coding. Let's see where the tide of tech goes.
