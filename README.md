# Developer Portfolio made by Me (Durwankur S. Naik)

## Made using Astro and SolidJS

Before I was using Next.JS for this website but then I realised I don't need Next for static site like this and just migrated the whole site using Astro and made use of SolidJS for some reactive components. Well, choosing SolidJS over ReactJS was obvious, Solid is more performant than ReactJS.

I would be adding Blog section in this later on and try to share my thoughts on it without any monitoring or any sensorship like that. This would be my free space on the Internet. Feels great to have one.

If you like this site and want to make it yours, feel free to clone it and change it according to your needs, or not, who cares. Well, if it works, don't touch it, right!
## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
I used pnpm, if you don't have pnpm installed, go ahed with npm or yarn, whatever you use.
